## This game's story is about a mouse trying to find it's way through this over-sized world.

The player has no idea that it's a mouse but little clues here and there hint at it. For example, everything is huge, you like cheese a lot, and you dislike cats and big animals.

While the player is tiny, we will assume that this mouse has the abilities and strength to manipulate various found objects.

The story elements should include something like this:

* the house/property is owned by a widowed old man.
* His memory is fading but his routine hasn't. He enjoys reading various books that he use to read to his family.
* The house is in disrepair as he doesn't have the strength to clean it very often.
* Though out the property, you'll find books laying here and there, pictures of family, and measurements marked on walls (children's height at various ages) and other elements that triggers memories (good and bad).


General notes about every room:

* Add descriptions for walls, floors, and ceiling (if any).
* Add descriptions for any portals (doors, windows, etc.).
* Every room should have a short and long description. The short description is shown by default upon entrance of a room
* The room's long description is revealed once the player executes 'examine room' command.
* Each room opens with the short description followed by directions.
* Picking up objects in a room should go like this: 'get <(noun) object>'. For example, if the player sees the wooden snake toy, he'd have to command, 'get toy'.


### Room 1: Study

Directions:

	To the west, you see a messy looking hole in the wall that you could probably squeeze through if you tried. To the east, you see faint light spilling out from what looks like a kitchen.

Description of Study (short):

	TBD

Description of Study (long):

	TBD

  Items of no interest:
  
    books, half broken bookshelves, well worn red-brown plush chair, shaded window, red velvet vintage smoking jacket, vintage smoking pipe and stand

Walls:

	Surrounding the study, are Oak walls laden with crafted designs stretching towards the ceiling.

Books:

	* "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" by Beatrix Potter (1902)
	* "Nineteen Eighty-Four" by George Orwell (1949)
	* "Alice in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll (reprint)
	* "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!": Adventures of a Curious Character (1989)
	* "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie" by Laura Numeroff (1985)
	* 

Plush chair:
   
    This tan and gold trimmed plush chair looks deteriorated but is still very inviting for one to sit in if one was reading a book found within this study. This comfy chair looks Victorian in design with pieces of the gold tufted back stuffing missing from the outer edges. The low arms suggests this chair is more for entertaining than reading but here it sits nonetheless.
    A red smoking jacket rests over the left arm and into the seat.
    You would sit in it if you weren't worried about messing the jacket's appearance.
    Under the chair, you notice a shabby sepia-toned picture of two children. Judging by the picture's used condition, it must have been a favorite picture of the parents.

Window:

    Its difficult to see out the window as it wasn't been washed in years. Dirt and grime make for some interesting natural patterns but not so much to hold your interest more than a moment.
    The shade is half drawn and slightly ajar to the right. You're sure that if you lived here, you would attempt to straighten it out.
    What little light there is outside illuminates the immediate area around this locked portal. The paint on the window sill is cracked and looks like it could be peeled off. The paint's color seems to be not well matched for the wallpaper surrounding the window frame.

Smoking jacket:
   
    A red velvet smoking jackets lies comfortably on the plush chair. This venerable jacket has seen better days but it still looks very comfy to wear while one would potentially lounge in this study smoking a pipe thoughtfully. This eccentric smoking jacket contains a well-folded faded black and white picture of a young couple. They look happy together holding hands on some distant lake pier. The lake looks familiar but you cannot place the memory.
    While the jacket does interest you, it is much too big for you to wear.

Bookshelves:

    The towering bookshelves are made of the same deep brown-red wood that you see outside the window. There are two aged bookshelves on each wall with the exception of the walls with the sooty window and wood-framed doorway. Most of the shelves are in decent condition but one is all but fallen apart. The lower shelves have a thick layer of dust dotted with an occasional footprint of something that looks maybe like a cat's paw. Each shelf is overfilled with a wide variety of well-used books of all sizes and colors. Its easy to tell which books have been read recently and others have collected dust bunnies for years.

Smoking pipe and stand:
   
    On a quaint stand next to the plush chair, sits a vintage smoking pipe is a deep brown wood with a brass connector between the worn bowl and curved stem. The pipe rests on an experienced pipe stand that has a matching wood base with horizontal gold painted pen lines with a slightly damaged corner and a faded brass upright for the pipe to rest on. The pipe stand smells of old tobacco and ashes. The pipe appeal seems to be very high to its owner but very low to you. (https://www.pinterest.com/pin/390968811377385947/)

Stand:
   
	This curious stand complements the plush chair nicely. On the underside, you see a burned inscription that reads, "Made in Utah, USA 1941". A smoking pipe and pipe stand are the only items resting atop the stand.

### Room 3: Hole in a Wall

Description of Hole in a Wall (short):

	Crawling through a mess of insulation electrical wires and plaster the path opens up to reveal a tiny living quarter. Could there be someone else living here my same size? There is some tiny furniture and strange papers and markings lining the walls.

Description of Hole in a Wall (long):

	TBD

Tiny table (thread spool):

Tiny chair (bottle cap):

Writing on the Wall:

	Reads: "Escape Plan" scratched at the top, underneath there is a weave of dental floss and paper clippings, most of which look to be torn down in some fit of rage. As a whole, the work is utterly illegible.
	
### Room 4: Overgrown Backyard

Description of Overgrown Backyard (short):

	There is a small patio with a tall willow tree hanging low overhead. A few tools are leaning up against the house. There is no way to see out over the rest of the property as mother nature has long since take over. Anything could be out there.

Description of Overgrown Backyard (long):

	TBD

Pile of Peanut Butter:

	For some reason this feels more dangerous then it looks at first glance. 

Gardening Tools:

	A pile of rusty old tools. These have not seen use for ages.


	
### Room 5: Box of old cereal

Story:

	Using the knife on a box of cereal, you can open the box and enter it.
	But the box falls and traps you inside it. Your knife is dropped outside the box (lost from player's inventory and add the knife to the room's inventory).
